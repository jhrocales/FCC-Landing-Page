                    The Playmakers-USTP Music Organization, founded by Mark Gonzales in 2013 and currently having Engr. Jerry Halibas as a coordinator, is part of the Arts and Culture Division.
                    With its 80 dedicated members, Playmakers - USTP is responsible for organizing and managing participants for music-related campus events such as performances, concerts,
                    and music competitions.

                    Playmakers manages around three to four events each month, which is a significant workload considering the members are also students with academic responsibilities and having a frequency of three times a week practices for an upcoming event. 
                    Below is an example of an event done by members.
